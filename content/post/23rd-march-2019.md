# Post Class Overview
## What we covered
[Code Along Project](/code-along/js2)

```html
<input type='number' id='firstNumber' placeholder='First number' />
```

{{< highlight js "linenos=table,linenostart=1" >}}
  const element = document.getElementById("firstNumber");
{{< / highlight >}}

There were a few learning points that we need to have drilled in to our heads,
`document.getElementById` returns the **HTML element** and not the value that it is having.
